## Work Experience

###### **Classic Graphics**, 2011-Present
My start at Classic began as an intern in the Development department. In January of 2012 I was given the opportunity to come on full-time as a part of the development team with a focus on Theming/Front-end work. Classic Graphics has been using Drupal heavily since version 4.6 and years later Drupal is still their platform of choice to and build and maintain web applications. I have had the great pleasure of collaborating on applications for large-scale enterprise organizations.

###### **Freelance Front-end development**, 2009-Present
During my time freelancing I have had the opportunity to work on a wide array of projects of scope and size. These vary from converting small business' and non-profits over to Drupal, to taking PSD's and converting them to Drupal theme's, to contributing on larger scale web applications built on Drupal by theming and site-building.


###### **J.F Hurley YMCA**, 2006-2011
While being employed at the YMCA I  served as a Lifeguard in the Aquatics department. During my time there I learned valuable experience pertaining to safety, team collaboration, & responsibility. It was a great exercise in learning how to cary a lot of weight in various situations and provide good customer service to the members.


## Education
###### **Rowan-Cabarrus Community College**, 2009-2012
